Create a phpMyAdmin database named 'courier' with the collation 'latin1_swedish_ci'. After the database is created, import the SQL file named 'courier.sql' located in this repository.

To log in to the admin page, use the username 'admin' and the password 'password.' Employees can be registered by the admin only.

The JavaScript code is embedded within the HTML and PHP file; there are no separate files for JavaScript.

The SQL table is empty, so register the customer and employee yourself.And also book the orders
